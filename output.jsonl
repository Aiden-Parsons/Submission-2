["Copied   Yall can call me crazy all day but you cant tell me this doesnt make you feel some kinda way  The Floyd event was staged Im not saying racism doesnt exist but hear me out  Staged Event   These officers were involved with something Im not sure exactly what but something is just not adding up I think there is at the very least the possibility that this was a filmed public execution of a black man by a white cop with the purpose of creating racial tensions and driving a wedge in the growing group of anti deep state sentiment from comon people that have already been psychologically traumatized by Covid 19 fears  Historically in  election years and in politically contested areas or in groups racial or gun violence incidents are becoming common place  Considering the rising approval rating of President Trump in the black community an event like this was unfortunately Predictable Consider these points and contrast them to every other police brutality incident youve ever seen The filmed portion of the incident was about 10 minutes long   In that amount of time three officers are holding one handcuffed man down You only know that because of the pictures taken from across the street You cant see the other two officers in the video because they are behind the vehicle  During 8 minutes of the entire video the officer has his knee on George Floyds neck which is not taught or approved by any law enforcement agency  Additionally other than the Asian officer speaking occasionally to the crowd of bystanders there is no communication from any of the officers to Mr Floyd  No talking no shouting  When have you ever seen a police brutality video without police shouting Additionally the police had no goal  They werent trying to subdue him for arrest he was already handcuffed and all they needed to do was place him in the back of the car  There is no plausible explanation for taking him to the ground and having three men on top of a handcuffed man a knee placed on his neck  Mr Floyd presented no threat and was not resisting   The only goal that there appeared to be was exactly what happened To be filmed brutally killing a black man  Think about this these officers did not care about being filmed in fact the officer stared into the camera with soulless eyes and an emotionless face reminiscent of an assassin as he knowingly killed an American Citizen None of the officers spoke among themselves or did they speak to Mr Floyd  They did not respond to his pleas for life They just sat and kneeled on him until he was passed out and then waited an additional 4 minutes after Mr Floyd lost consciousness to ensure that Mr Floyd was dead and could not be revived  The bystanders are verbally communicating to the officers that he isnt breathing Unlike any other similar incident you never see the officers getting on police radios You never see or hear them calling dispatch for backup No other police units arrive on the scene and strangely enough the crowd does not seem to grow either The scene does not end until an ambulance arrives and they unceremoniously flop him on a gurney  At no point does anyone in a uniform ever check his vitals As if they arent remotely curious about the situation they are in BTW who called the ambulance and for what reason Because if the reason was that Mr Floyd was having a medical issue they wouldnt have still been crushing his neck   Shortly after the video went viral a fake Facebook page supposedly belonging to the officer  at the center of the murder appears and pictures are uploaded that say Stand your Ground and Trump 2020   A picture of the cop with a red ballcap that says Make America White Again  A friends list populated with obvious sock accounts and people clearly not his friends   This is the same kind of fake Facebook stunt that happened with a group made to look like support for the men involved with the Ahmed Aubrey case Is it mere coincidence that this happens the week after race becomes a major political issue after the Biden You aint Black gaffe started to threaten the black vote the Democrats so desperately count on  Additionally there is substantial video evidence to arrest at least one officer now  Why would the local authorities not charge him immediately unless there was a political advantage not to  Is it mere coincidence that this happens right about the exact moment the COVID19 fear campaign falls apart and after it has psychologically traumatized the entire country and got everyone at each others throats and suicide attempts are spiking

regarding President Trump He starts with Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries havent seen before The former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger gives us a new understanding of President Donald Trumps foreign policy and predicts its success Liberals and all those who favor Hillary Clinton will never admit it They will never admit that he is the one true leader  The man is doing changes like never before and does all of it for the sake of this nations people After eight years of tyranny we finally see a difference Kissinger knows it and he continues with Every country now has to consider two things One their perception that the previous president or the outgoing president basically withdrew America from international politics so that they had to make their own assessments of their necessities And secondly that there is a new president whos asking a lot of unfamiliar questions  And because of the combination of the partial vacuum and the new questions one could imagine that something remarkable and new emerges out of it Then Kissinger puts it bluntly Trump puts America and its people first  This is why people love him and this is why he will remain in charge for so long  There is not a single thing wrong with him and people need to open their eyes  When he boasts that he has a bigger red button than Kim Jung Un does he so transcends the mealymouthed rhetoric of the past thereby forcing a new recognition of American power Kissinger once wrote The weak grow strong by effrontery  The strong grow weak through inhibition  No sentence better captures the USNorth

under Trump creates a new dynamic that every one of our allies and of our enemies must consider Our allies grew complacent with Obamas passivity and now are fearful due to Trumps activism  And they must balance the two in developing their policies They realize that the old assumptions catalyzed by Bush 43s preoccupation with Iraq and Obamas refusal to lead are obsolete  So Trump is forcing a new
